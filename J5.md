# CSCI 2113 - Worksheet J5
## Question 1. How does object-oriented programming pair so closely with GUIs?
GUIs are composed of mutiple elements like buttons, windows, text fields, menus, etc.
Implementing all these elements is a very challanging task, to avoid having to implement them every time a GUIs is created and to separate implementation from interfact, 
classes are used.  

## Question 2. What is the relationship between `WindowListener` and `WindowAdapter`?
WindowListener is an interface that can be used to implement a listener object. When a listener object is added to a 
window object it will decide what to do when each possible event happens to that window. The decision of what action to take for each event will be decided by the methods to be implemented by the WindowListener interface. WindowAdapter is a class that implements the WindowListener interface but with all functions empty. One can extend the WindowAdapter class to overwrite only the actions in which it actually wants to set up an response action. 

## Question 3. What does the program below produce for a GUI? (You can sketch and upload an image or describe it – do this without running the program to make sure you understand what each line below is doing).
The program creates one JFrame window, six JButton buttons, and two JPanel panels. The two panels are edit to have a BorderLayout LayoutManager
buttons two, three and five are added to the prime panel with positions EAST, WEST and NORTH, respectively. 
buttons four and six are added to the composites panel with positions NORTH and CENTER
Primes panel is added to the frame at WEST position 
Composites panel is added to the frame at EAST position 
Button one is added to the frame at CENTER position 

## Question 4. Modify the HelloGoodbyeEx2 code to update the number of times the button has been clicked on the button’s label itself. 
```java
public class ButtonClickListenerEx1 implements ActionListener {
    private int timeClicked;
    private JLabel label;
    
    public ButtonClickListenerEx1(JLabel label) {
        this.label = label; //save the label to modify
        this.timesClicked = 0;
    }


    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        timesClicked++;
        if (label.getText().equals("Hello")) {
            label.setText("Goodbye"); //flip text back and forth
        }else{
            label.setText("Hello");
        }
    }
}
```
## Question 5. Convert the ActionListeners to Lambda Functions.
```java
public class RedPillBluePill extends JFrame {
    JLabel label;

    public RedPillBluePill() {
        this.setSize(300, 300);
        this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

        JPanel panel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());        
        JButton red = new JButton("red");
        JButton blue = new JButton("blue");
        panel.add(red, BorderLayout.EAST);
        panel.add(blue, BorderLayout.WEST);
        label = new JLabel("click a button");
        this.add(label, BorderLayout.NORTH);
        this.add(panel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

        red.addActionListener((e) -> {label.setText("RED")});

        blue.addActionListener((e) -> {label.setText("BLUE")});
    }
}
```

## Question 6. Explain why for ActionListener you can use a Lambda function but for WindowListener you cannot?
The Actioner listener only requires a single method to be implemented wherears the the WindowListener requires multiple methods. Therefore the single method needed for ActionListener can be implemented by a Lambda function.

## Question 7. Write a program that allows you to enter a 6-digit PIN, like you would on your smartphone to unlock it.
```java
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.border.Border;

import java.awt.*;

public class Ex1JFrame {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        JFrame f = new JFrame();
        f.setTitle("Enter 6-digit PIN"); // sets title that appears on the top bar
        f.setSize(400, 400); // sets the size (in pixels) of the frame
        f.setLocation(100, 100); // sets the top-left corner of the window on the desktop

        JPanel topPanel = new JPanel();
        JPanel midPanel = new JPanel();
        JPanel bottomPanel = new JPanel();
        JPanel zeroPanel = new JPanel();

        JButton bOne = new JButton("1");
        JButton bTwo = new JButton("2");
        JButton bThree = new JButton("3");
        JButton bFour = new JButton("4");
        JButton bFive = new JButton("5");
        JButton bSix = new JButton("6");
        JButton bseven = new JButton("7");
        JButton beight = new JButton("8");
        JButton bnine = new JButton("9");
        JButton bzero = new JButton("0");
        JButton bbackspace = new JButton("<");

        topPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
        midPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
        bottomPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
        zeroPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());

        topPanel.add(bOne, BorderLayout.WEST);
        topPanel.add(bTwo, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        topPanel.add(bThree, BorderLayout.EAST);

        midPanel.add(bFour, BorderLayout.WEST);
        midPanel.add(bFive, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        midPanel.add(bSix, BorderLayout.EAST);

        bottomPanel.add(bseven, BorderLayout.WEST);
        bottomPanel.add(beight, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        bottomPanel.add(bnine, BorderLayout.EAST);

        zeroPanel.add(bbackspace, BorderLayout.WEST);
        zeroPanel.add(bzero, BorderLayout.CENTER);

        JPanel buttonPanel = new JPanel();
        buttonPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());

        buttonPanel.add(topPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH);
        buttonPanel.add(midPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        buttonPanel.add(bottomPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

        f.add(new JLabel("DISPLAY PIN AS TYPED"), BorderLayout.NORTH);
        f.add(buttonPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        f.add(zeroPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

        f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); // makes it so that closing window exits program
        f.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```
